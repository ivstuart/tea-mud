Release Notes for tea-mud version 1.0
-------------------------------------


What is tea-mud?
---------------

A text based Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) along the lines of Rite of Passage (ROP), Fate and other Elmen / Diku / Circle
muds. The code is all there for a version one of this code base. However there is considerable work to a builder to
make the world state files into a balanced mud world.

There is a lack of unit test for classes. This is historical and will continue given the amount of state that is
required to be set up to create tests v actually running the integrated code. One thought is to have helper methods
to load objects to make writing the test classes easier.

Setup Instructions
------------------

I recommended using the latest version of IntelliJ for development. The console supports ANSI text.

Install maven.

Right click on pom.xml and download external libraries required. I also recommend Java 8.

Run configurations main class:

 com.ivstuart.tmud.server.LaunchMud

Use putty / zmud / tintin++ to telnet to port 5678 (default port) or can use main class:

 com.ivstuart.tmud.server.LaunchClient


> look
> config ansi

This toggles off the ansi colour. In game.

Note that passwords are being checking now.
There is an easy option 5 which has been added to login as the admin user Ivan.

Just type look or 'l' to see your surroundings. Also see the eBook for more information.
